# 144-neural-phenotypes
A functional neurobehavioral taxonomy for applied cognitive and behavioral science.

This repository contains the finalized reference edition (v1.0) of **The 144 Neural Phenotypes**, a functional neurobehavioral taxonomy intended for applied and interpretive use in cognitive development, behavioral science, and architecture-level modeling of human cognitive styles.

## Scope
The work presents a descriptive framework composed of:
- 12 core neural domains
- 12 fundamental neurocognitive phenotypes
- 144 composite neurobehavioral profiles

The system is designed for immediate conceptual and applied use without requiring experimental instrumentation.

## Scientific Status
This work is intentionally presented as a **foundational framework**.  
Empirical validation, refinement, or falsification is explicitly deferred to future experimental research.

## Contents
- **The 144 Neural Phenotypes (PDF)** – complete reference edition
